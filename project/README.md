    #### Description:

This is a Python script containing three functions: add_numbers(), multiply_numbers(), and reverse_string(). The add_numbers() function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. If either of the inputs is negative, the function will return the absolute value of their difference. If both inputs are negative, the function will return the negative of their sum. The multiply_numbers() function also takes two numbers as input and returns their product. If either of the inputs is negative, the function will return the negative of their product. If both inputs are negative, the function will return the positive of their product. The reverse_string() function takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of the string, with each word reversed but maintaining their position in the string. The functions are designed to handle various input cases and provide useful results.

This script is designed to test the functionality of the functions in project.py. It includes three separate testing functions, each of which checks a specific functionality of the corresponding function in project.py.

The first testing function, test_add_numbers, ensures that the add_numbers function can correctly add two input numbers. The test cases include a range of possible input values, such as positive and negative numbers, and zeros. If the function returns the expected output for all test cases, the function is working as intended.

The second testing function, test_multiply_numbers, checks that the multiply_numbers function can correctly multiply two input numbers. Like the previous function, this testing function also includes a range of input values, such as positive and negative numbers, and zeros. If the function returns the expected output for all test cases, the function is working as intended.

The third testing function, test_reverse_string, tests the functionality of the reverse_string function. This function reverses a string and then reverses the order of the words in the string. The test cases include a variety of strings, including empty strings, single-word strings, and multi-word strings. If the function returns the expected output for all test cases, the function is working as intended.
